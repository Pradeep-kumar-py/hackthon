![OUTBREAKORACAL](Screenshot 2025-07-05 at 4.07.47 AM.png)

OUTBREAKORACAL is a robust tool designed to simulate and predict the spread of epidemics using advanced modeling techniques. This project aims to provide insightful data on disease progression, helping users understand potential outbreak scenarios and their impact.

Features

Epidemic Modeling: Utilizes established epidemiological models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) to simulate disease spread over time.

Interactive Visualizations: Presents simulation results through clear and intuitive graphs, making complex data easily understandable.

Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust key variables such as infection rates, recovery rates, population size, and intervention measures to explore various scenarios.

Prediction Capabilities: Offers projections on peak infection times, total infected individuals, and other critical metrics based on the simulation.
